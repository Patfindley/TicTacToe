# Tic Tac Toe Solo project

Everybody's got some time to kill sometimes, why not do it with classic Tic Tac Toe?

The goal of this project was not just to implement all of the javascript, HTML, & CSS tools learned throughout Mod 1 at Turing, but gain a further understanding of their usage.

## Learning Goals

* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - localStorage to persist data
    - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
